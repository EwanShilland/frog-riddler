## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#use back ticks times 3 for code bits
#use the green arrows to the right to run bits
# use {r echo = FALSE} if you don't want that bit of code to show up. {r message = FALSE} to suppress messages. A few other options.
```{r}
print("hello")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
comp <- read.csv('../data/compensation.csv')
glimpse(comp)
ggplot(comp, aes(x = Root, y = Fruit)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Grazing)
```

```{r}
#sup, Ewan. if you can see this, I have been in your internets.
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
